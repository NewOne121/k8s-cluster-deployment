# K8S-playground

This repository it's like a lab of "Kubenetes the hard way" (https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)<br> 
I'm building installation scripts of kubernetes on bare-metal/VM's without using GCP as originally proposed.<br>

The goal it's to understand internals of kubernetes in terms of low-level installation and configuration.
Also, it's attempt to create ready-to-go installation/management script to create/scale k8s clusters.

`In development`
